      <description>I am a default Swedish man. I have a background in mechanical engineering (CNC) and rock&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;roll lyfestyle. Currently I am mostly doing computer stuff and play Tetris (NES). I also made this, budlabs thing.
I have a playlist on youtube called bra grejjer, mostly music videos I like. It is a good complement to this document when painting a picture of my identity.

      <description>budlabs is the banner under which I, budRich, publish my various creations. I thought it would be a good idea to have a mock organization that&amp;rsquo;s more reliable and easier to understand then myself. It was a good idea.
I had just read The Idea Factory when i named it, the name is a play on &amp;ldquo;Bell Labs&amp;quot;.</description>
